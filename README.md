# Keith JS Bot
*Soon... I will replace all of Keith's communications*

## About
This project is a Telegram chatbot that is meant to act as the server for incoming messages to the bot. You can find the bot on Telegram at @keithjsbot or https://t.me/keithjsbot .

## How this came about
I chanced upon the possibility to download all of one's social media interactions, be if from facebook messenger, whatsapp, telegram etc. Then, I had an epiphany and thought that it would be amazing if I could use all this personal conversation data to train an AI to model after my online speech patterns. If it reaches that stage, I would love to try this on my friends and family and see if it can pass the Turing Test. That would be really exciting!

## List of Available commands
* /start - Displays a simple welcome message when user first talks to bot
* /echo - Usage: /echo (input text without the parentheses)
* /keithsays - testing testing...
